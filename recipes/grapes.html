        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a hard one to get right. One of the most technical dishes in the michelan registry, grapes are <em>the</em> dish to impress your friends, colleagues, and the world.
            A good grape is practically impossible to make. Most curated chefs don't even try, as to not embarass themselves. Absolute control of the elements and knives and the stove and shit is required. Don't gasp tho. 
            A handful of talented chefs working together with the use of the now-tragic Microsoft Teams 19 "hive mind" were able to create spheres similar in taste and color to grapes. They unfortunately exploded tho, killing people n stuff.
